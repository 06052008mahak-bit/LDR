       <h3><u>About Lana Del Rey</u></h3> 
      <section>
        <i><h4>Early Life</h4></i>
        <p>Lana Del Rey, born Elizabeth Woolridge Grant on June 21, 1985, in Manhattan, New York, grew up in Lake Placid, a small town in upstate New York. She was raised in a Catholic family and attended Catholic school before later studying philosophy at Fordham University in the Bronx. As a teenager, she developed an interest in music and began singing in her church choir, eventually writing her own songs and performing in clubs around New York City. These early experiences shaped her artistic style, blending nostalgic Americana with melancholic themes that would later define her career.

    <h4><i> Albums</i></h3>
    <p>she began her discography with Lana Del Ray A.K.A. Lizzy Grant in 2010, a project that was later pulled from circulation but marked her first step into the industry. Her breakthrough came in 2012 with Born to Die, which included hits like “Video Games” and “Summertime Sadness,” followed later that year by the Paradise EP. In 2014, she shifted toward a darker, rock-influenced sound with Ultraviolence, and then embraced dreamy orchestral textures in Honeymoon (2015). By 2017, she was collaborating with artists such as The Weeknd and Stevie Nicks on Lust for Life.
Her critical peak arrived in 2019 with Norman F**ing Rockwell!*, widely hailed as one of her greatest works. She followed that with two albums in 2021—Chemtrails Over the Country Club and Blue Banisters—both more introspective and folk-inspired. In 2023, she released Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, a deeply poetic and expansive record. Looking ahead, she has announced her tenth studio album, Stove, expected in 2026, which suggests yet another evolution in her artistry.
